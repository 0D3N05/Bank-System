ðŸ’¼ Welcome to Bank System

This is my current project â€” and it's already complete! 

However, I may continue improving it from time to time.

This program was built to help me practice implementing the single linked list data structure in a real-world scenario.

ðŸ§¾ About the Program:

â€¢ 	Simulates a real-life banking system (features include: create_acc , deposit , withdraw , display , etc.)

â€¢ 	Built using a single linked list

â€¢ 	Save feature not yet implemented â€” might be added in future updates

If you spot any errors or have any questions, feel free to contact me:
